# IRF (Identification by Random Forest)
Eye-movement event detection using random forest

This repository will contain code and trained classifier to detect events in eye-tracking data. 
Algorithm and first results were presented at [Scandinavian Workshop of Applied Eye Tracking](http://swaet2016.utu.fi/) in June 2016.
